spotify_chat
============

real time chat and spotify streaming using node, websockets, angularjs and html5 audio

run

Right now I have it setup so that you need a spotify premium account to run. If you do you'll have to
enter your credentials in server.js. I plan to change this in the future so that it is not dependant upon
the service, this was more for demo purposes.

``` bash
npm install
grunt build
foreman start
```
